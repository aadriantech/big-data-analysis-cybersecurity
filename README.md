# Project Overview: Big Data Analysis for Cybersecurity

This project demonstrates the integration of Hadoop with Python to analyze and visualize big data for cybersecurity purposes. By utilizing Hadoop's distributed computing capabilities alongside Python's analytical and visualization libraries, we can efficiently process large datasets to identify and analyze cybersecurity threats. This README outlines the key components, setup, and execution of the project.

## Components

- **Hadoop**: A framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.
- **Python**: A programming language that offers extensive support for data analysis and visualization through libraries such as pandas, Plotly, and Pydoop.
- **Mapper and Reducer Scripts**: Custom Python scripts that filter and aggregate data, designed to run within the Hadoop framework.
- **Visualization**: Using Plotly to create visual representations of the analyzed data.

## Setup

1. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Install Hadoop and configure the environment to support distributed data processing.
   - Ensure Python is installed with the required libraries (`pandas`, `plotly.express`, and `pydoop`).

2. **Hadoop Configuration**:
   - Copy necessary Hadoop configuration files to the appropriate directory.
   - Format the HDFS namenode and start Hadoop services (DFS and YARN).

3. **Data Generation**:
   - Run provided Python scripts to generate simulated logs for analysis (e.g., SSH login attempts, web access logs).

4. **Data Processing with Hadoop**:
   - Use the Hadoop streaming utility to execute mapper and reducer scripts on the generated logs.
   - Analyze logs for patterns indicative of cybersecurity threats (e.g., repeated failed login attempts, access to known malicious URLs).

5. **Visualization**:
   - Use Python to read the output of the reducer scripts from HDFS.
   - Generate charts using Plotly to visualize the analysis results, making the data easily interpretable.

## Execution

1. **Start Hadoop Services**: Initialize Hadoop's DFS and YARN services to ensure the cluster is ready for data processing.

2. **Generate Log Data**: Execute the log generation scripts to simulate cybersecurity-related events.

3. **Run MapReduce Jobs**: Submit jobs to Hadoop to process the generated logs, specifying the custom mapper and reducer scripts.

4. **Visualize Results**: Use the visualization script to read the MapReduce output from HDFS and generate graphical representations of the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power of combining Hadoop's distributed data processing capabilities with Python's data analysis and visualization libraries to address cybersecurity challenges. By efficiently processing and visualizing big data, we can uncover insights into security threats, enabling better decision-making and enhancing our cybersecurity posture.

## Notes

- Ensure all paths and environment variables are correctly set according to your system's configuration.
- Modify the scripts as needed to adapt to different datasets or analysis requirements.
- Regularly review and update the cybersecurity patterns and indicators within the scripts to keep up with evolving threats.

This project serves as a foundational framework for big data analysis in cybersecurity, demonstrating a scalable approach to handling vast datasets and extracting actionable insights.
